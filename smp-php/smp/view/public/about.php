          <p>It connects a student commencing their first semester of undergraduate study with another student who is further along in the same course. This helps the new student, studying either on-campus or at distance, to quickly and successfully settle into university life and there is no charge involved.</p>
          <p>New students benefit from the experience of their mentor, who help the new student adjust and guide them to appropriate support services available at Southern Cross University.</p>
          <p>The program is available for all new undergraduate students, studying by distance or on-campus at Lismore, Coffs Harbour or Tweed Gold Coast.</p>
