SMP (Student Mentoring Program) is a project a part of Computing project 1 & 2 units 
at Southern Cross University.

Current programming code written by Java .
We using Spring-Roo for increasing team productivity. 
We also using Spring framework, Hibernate, Spring MVC, Spring Security, etc.  

Unfortunately we still didn't get good support from our client, 
it means programming language may be change to PHP or Python 
because of their limited web servers. (I hope not ;-))
